# Words That Matter

[PLAY HERE](http://dosomethinggames.github.io/words-that-matter)

This is a web game created by [Andrea Gonzales](http://github.com/andrea-3000), [Jasmine Mithani](http://github.com/jmithani), and [Jon Uy](http://github.com/jonuy) for DoSomething.org. The player navigates the game as a high schooler on their way to prom. Throughout gameplay, the player learns different, more subtle ways unhealthy relationships can manifest. At the end of the game, the player is given a chance to intervene in a situation. After, statistics relating to unhealthy relationships are shown, and then the player can choose to sign up for a DoSomething.org campaign to combat the numbers.
