<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="&gt; I promised, didn&#39;t I?" tags="" position="271,144">&gt; I guess you did, haha.

<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="&gt; -_____________________-" tags="" position="521,140">&gt; Hey! I am perfectly capable of dressing myself!

[[&gt; Like when you wore plaid pants to meet my parents?]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="&gt; Like when you wore plaid pants to meet my parents?" tags="" position="646,140">&gt; Excuse you, they&#39;re *fashion forward.*

&gt; Haha, whatever.
[[&gt; I&#39;ll see you at 8, then?]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="9" name="&gt; I&#39;ll see you at 8, then?" tags="" position="771,139">&gt; Yep, on the dot!
&gt; Can&#39;t wait. :)

[[Next.]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Next." tags="" position="896,137">You pull up to Alex&#39;s house and put the car in park. It&#39;s 7:55. Text them and let them know you&#39;re here.

[[&gt; I&#39;m outside. Ready when you are!]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="11" name="&gt; I wish I was there, it&#39;s cute to watch you think." tags="" position="145,143">&gt; :P
&gt; At least classes are over now.
&gt; Are you still going to pick me up before the dance?

[[&gt; Yessir!]]
[[&gt; I promised, didn&#39;t I?]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="12" name="&gt; I&#39;m outside. Ready when you are!" tags="" position="17,269">8:02.

Should you text Alex again?

[[&gt; Hello? I&#39;m outside.]]
[[No, wait a bit.]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="13" name="&gt; Hello? I&#39;m outside." tags="" position="153,273">8:12.

[[Stay in car.]]
[[Go knock on door.]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="14" name="No, wait a bit." tags="" position="13,411">8:07.

They did say 8 o&#39;clock sharp.

[[Wait-&gt;&gt; Hello? I&#39;m outside.]] </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Stay in car." tags="" position="138,411">8:17.

It&#39;s getting late. You might not make it to the dance in time. 

[[Go knock on door.]] </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Go knock on door." tags="" position="283,273">The door burst open. Alex is standing there, smiling, draped in a floor-length gown. Over the skirt are streamers of fabric in all different shades of blue and green - handsewn on, of course. Alex has on dark green lipstick and lots - and really, a *lot* - of eyeshadow.

[[&quot;I texted you.&quot;-&gt;Oh my gosh!]]
[[&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for twenty minutes.&quot;-&gt;Oh my gosh!]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Oh my gosh!" tags="" position="276,410">&quot;Oh my gosh! I was so busy getting ready I didn&#39;t check my phone!&quot;

They twirl around, and the streamers flow in a circle around them, reminiscent of seaweed.

&quot;What do you think? I even went to the beach last weekend and got some seawater to use as perfume! See, smell!&quot;

They jump into your arms and you do smell the seawater, regrettably. It smells like fish and sewage and you sigh. You tried to control Alex, but it looks like it didn&#39;t work.

[[&quot;We should hurry, we&#39;re going to be late.&quot;-&gt;Sorry.]]
[[&quot;You did say 8 o&#39;clock...we really get to get going.&quot;-&gt;Sorry.]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Sorry." tags="" position="408,274">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, ready to go?&quot;

[[Yep!-&gt;Of course.]]
[[Are you positive you have everything?-&gt;Of course.]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Of course." tags="" position="408,413">&quot;Of course, [[let&#39;s go]]!&quot;</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="20" name="let&#39;s go" tags="" position="533,274">8:36. You&#39;re on your way to the dance. Things are a bit tense - the two of you sit in silence. Alex is going through their bag.

&quot;Shoot, I can&#39;t find my wallet.&quot;

[[&quot;Seriously?&quot;-&gt;I must have left it]]
[[&quot;I thought you said you had everything!&quot;-&gt;I must have left it]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="21" name="I must have left it" tags="" position="537,413">&quot;I must have left it when I grabbed my phone.&quot;

You sigh, exasperated.

[[Do you really need it?-&gt;Um]]
[[Do we need to turn back?-&gt;Um]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Um" tags="" position="658,274">Alex looks at their hands. &quot;Um...if it wouldn&#39;t be too much trouble...&quot;

[[You already made us late, no one will notice a few more minutes.]]

[[We&#39;re already running late...]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="23" name="You already made us late, no one will notice a few more minutes." tags="" position="662,413">Ariel&#39;s gaze doesn&#39;t leave their lap. &quot;Thanks.&quot;

[[Next-&gt;Next 2]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="24" name="We&#39;re already running late..." tags="" position="783,278">Alex&#39;s gaze doesn&#39;t leave their lap. &quot;Okay...I guess I don&#39;t really need it for tonight.&quot;

[[Next-&gt;Next 2]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Next 2" tags="" position="787,411">You two hurry through the entrance to the dance hall, and then freeze. There are people everywhere - talking, laughing, milling about. You squint your eyes, trying to look for a free table admist all of the tumbling colors. 

You turn to Alex. &quot;We got here too late, it looks like all the tables are taken.&quot;
Alex shakes their head, and starts bouncing up and down excitedly. 
&quot;No, look! I see Sam over there!&quot;

You follow their finger, and sure enough, your friends have a table near the band. Sam is standing up, waving his hands.
&quot;Guys! Over [[here]]!&quot;

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="26" name="here" tags="" position="908,277">Sam smiles as you two approach, and gives an exaggerated bow. There are two seats saved. You and Alex both sit down and take stock of everyone around you.

Sam and his date Luis have on matching blue bowties and kerchiefs. Ruby&#39;s dress a deep orange, and her bangs are tucked behind her with a hairpin made from coral - their theme, it looks like, as Zane has a piece in his jacket pocket. Alex is definitely the most committed to the theme - you can see that while you refused matching gill, they drew some in on their neck. 

You notice that everyone has gotten food. You motion to Alex, and you get up and [[head to the buffet]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="27" name="head to the buffet" tags="" position="914,410">something something not nice in private emphasize public/private persona [[shift]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="28" name="shift" tags="" position="1045,276.6666666666667">You slid back into your seat and dig your fork into your pasta. Alex does the same, but eats at a much slower pace - they don&#39;t share your ravenous appetite. 

Everyone else has already finished their meal. Ruby puts her elbows on the table and leans towards you.

&quot;Alex, I love what you did with your makeup! It looks just like seaweed.&quot;

You snort.
